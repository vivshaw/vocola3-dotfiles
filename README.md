# vocola3-dotfiles
This is my grammar for voice programming using Windows Speech Recognition and the [Vocola 3 voice command language](http://vocola.net/default.asp). This project started because I developed nerve
injuries in my wrists and elbows that prevented me from coding for a long time. But after seeing projects like [VoiceCode.io](VoiceCode.io), [Aenea](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/aenea),
[Silvius](http://voxhub.io/silvius), and [Tavis Rudd's project](http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/using_voice_to_code.html), I decided to write my own grammar and try voice programming. At the moment,
it's only good enough for some basic web coding, browser use, and Git Bash, but I hope to improve it until I can use it for all of my development. I will likely migrate to a Dragon-based
solution like Dragonfly at some point, but in the meanwhile, I figured that my grammar might be useful to others who don't have Dragon, so I might as well polish it as best I can and put it
on GitHub.

This grammar is still in heavy development, and is rather a mess at the moment. I'll be updating this readme with a description of the commands as I implement them.

## Installation
In order to use this grammar, you'll first need to activate Windows Speech Recognition and install [Vocola 3](http://vocola.net/default.asp). You'll also need Sublime Text, Git Bash, and the Chrome
browser with Vimium, as these were the applications that I designed the grammar around. Once these are all working, you can clone this repo into your Vocola 3 settings folder (likely at
C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Vocola3\), replacing its contents.
